        <h1>That time I went sky diving</h1>
        <p>Finally, It was my 18th birthday. After years and years of talking about it and looking forward to it I was finally able to go. Sky diving! I had the urge to jump out of a plane for years and was finally of age to go and do it. My birthday being in July, It was a hot summer day. My friend Evan, brother Ryan, and I woke up at the crack of dawn to drive up north to Sussex, NJ to go skydiving. When we finally got to "Sky Dive Sussex", the first thing they made us do was sign waivers and watch this video telling us what not to do and how they were not liable if we were to die that day. Shortly after signing the forms and watching the training videos, we were suited up and boarding a small cessna aircraft. The plane itself was one of those small little planes that could probably only fit 10 people. As we cruised higher and higher I started to feel fear and could not believe how high up we actually were. We kept getting higher and higher until reaching about 15,000 ft (I am pretty sure this was the jump to the best of my knowledge). Once we reached 15,000 ft, one by one, we started jumping out of the airplane. When my turn came up, I was shaking of fear, until I jumped out of the plane in free fall staring back at it watching the plane get smaller and smaller as I dropped. Free fall felt crazy, as if I was floating and felt like I could see the everything from up there. After free fall we pulled the parachute and slowly flew like a kite for several minutes. It was very peaceful up there, but at the same time my blood was rushing and adrenaline was pumping. We started to descend to our landing, in which we glided and skided on the grass. I had such an adrenaline rush, it felt like a natural high. I could not believe the jump was over and I was relieved that I had survived. It was an amazing experience and I highly recommend it.  </p>
